CREATION OF PACKAGES
AIM:
To implement Packages.
THEORY:
A package is a schema object that groups logically related PL/SQL types, variables, constants,
subprograms, cursors, and exceptions. A package is compiled and stored in the database, where many applications can share its contents.
CREATE [OR REPLACE] PACKAGE <package_name> IS
<sub_program and public element declaration> END <package name>
Questions:
1)	CREATE PACKAGE SPECIFICATION CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE Pk1 AS
PROCEDURE proc1(a int,b int); END Pk1;

2)	PACKAGE BODY
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY Pk1 AS
PROCEDURE proc1(a int,b int) IS BEGIN
dbms_output.put_line('Sum:'||(a+b)); END proc1;
END Pk1;
 

3)	
READ VALUES DECLARE
p int;
q int; BEGIN
p:=:p;
q:=:q;
Pk1.proc1(p,q); END;

Question:

 Create a package pk1 consisting of the following functions and procedures Procedure proc1 to find the sum, average and product of two numbers
Procedure proc2 to find the square root of a number
Function named fn11 to check whether a number is even or not A function named fn22 to find the sum of 3 numbers
Use this package in a PL/SQL program. Call the functions f11, f22 and procedures pro1, pro2 within the program and display their result.
